## üèÜ Reflecting on My Development Journey 

### ‚úèÔ∏è Planning and Wireframing

The foundation of my portfolio project began with planning and consideration of the details:

- **Inspiration Gathering:** I scoured Dribbble, various websites, and explored fellow developers' portfolios to draw inspiration. This included exploring UI/UX, animations, effects, and the desired sections and features.

- **Design Deliberation:** With inspiration in hand, I envisioned the design, paying careful attention to the user interface and experience. I considered animations and effects that would captivate visitors.

- **Color Palette Selection:** To ensure a visually appealing aesthetic, I leveraged color selection tools like Coolors and Realtime Colors to create a harmonious color scheme.

- **UI Stack Research:** My quest for UI perfection led me to resources like Stack Sorted. I explored buttons, hover effects, cursor animations, and more to enhance the user experience.

- **Logo Crafting:** I turned to logo.com to create a distinctive logo that would symbolize my brand and identity.

With these initial thoughts in place, I started on creating wireframes that served as a visual roadmap. The wireframe laid out the layout and structure of the page, providing a clear guide for design and CSS implementation. It was a crucial step in bringing my vision to life.

### üéØ Challenges and Lessons Learned

### 1. Learning About Headless Content Management Systems (CMS) ‚ô®Ô∏è

- Initially, I explored using Sanity, which turned out to be complex and an overkill for my needs. The self-hosted backend database added unnecessary complexity.
- The unclear documentation and frequent version changes made it challenging to start, especially regarding hosting issues.
- I eventually switched to Contentful, which was far more user-friendly and hosted on their end. It streamlined the content management process.
- However, a bug surfaced when reloading the page, causing a failure to display content. I had to revert to hard-coding data, but I remain determined to resolve this issue and keep exploring CMS options.


### 2. Lessons from Using the Mantine Carousel üí°
- I implemented a carousel using the Mantine library but overlooked installing the core CSS UI package.
- This mistake led to issues with the carousel's functionality, and I spent time troubleshooting without realizing the core problem.
- This experience reinforced the importance of thoroughly reading documentation, rather than only focusing on specific features to save time.
- I learned to read the entire documentation and adapt it to my code, avoiding shortcuts.
- Additionally, during the package installation, I encountered compatibility issues due to a cluttered codebase. The lesson here is to keep code clean and remove unused or older versions of APIs.


### 3. Importance of Research and Library Selection ‚ú®

- This project highlighted the significance of diligent research and careful selection of libraries, APIs, or packages tailored to the application's needs.
- Blindly choosing popular options without considering compatibility and detailed documentation can lead to unexpected challenges.
- A comprehensive understanding of the libraries and their interactions is crucial to prevent issues down the road.



## ‚úÖ Future Features

1. Enhance code organization by refactoring components for better readability and maintainability.
2. Continuously enrich the portfolio by adding new, diverse projects that showcase my evolving skills and creativity.
3. Introduce a user-friendly sidebar with contact icons.
4. Add loading effect on page load.
5. Extend the Contentful or other CMS integration to manage all website content, going beyond just projects, simplifying content management and ensuring real-time updates.
6. Elevate the portfolio by converting it into a Progressive Web App, offering offline access, enhanced performance, and an app-like experience for users.
